        FAUSTY

Fausty is a small, lightweight GTK IDE for developing Faust code. It is not intended to replace the existing and superior FaustWorks IDE.

I wrote this little program just to gain some experience using C++ to
spawn processes, communicate with things trough pipes etc, and also because
I like Faust :)
